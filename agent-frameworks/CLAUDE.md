# CLAUDE.md — CLIs and coding agents

> **THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT.** The State of the Union for this folder, in the same
> **W5+H** schema as the blueprint — so target and status line up header for
> header and the gap is readable at a glance.

## Gospel

**[`../canon/MASTER-BUILD-BLUEPRINT.md`](../canon/MASTER-BUILD-BLUEPRINT.md)** is
the target: the W5+H universal blueprint (§1), the build map (§12.1), the action
chart (§12.2), the flip chart (§12.3), the file architecture (§12).

**This folder is a comparison against it.** Same six headers below. If this folder
and the blueprint disagree, the blueprint is the target and this is the status.

## State of the Union — W5+H

### WHO
Candidate tools, not a chosen stack. Which one wins is decided by use.

### WHAT
open-wiki, llm-wiki, aider, hermes, claude-ai reference, claude-code-android, open-claude-android, github-mcp.

### WHERE
Documentation only. **Code does not live here** — the vendored checkouts were excised; each entry records what it is and where its source lives.

### WHEN
Consulted when choosing a tool for a job. Not on any critical path.

### WHY
So a tool's purpose survives the person who forked it.

### HOW
One folder per tool: what it is, why it was pulled in, its upstream and fork.

## Delta

Most entries are a fork and a note. **Nothing here is integrated.**

**Build state is not recorded here.** It is recorded once, in
[`../canon/STATE-OF-EXISTENCE.md`](../canon/STATE-OF-EXISTENCE.md). No folder
asserts its own status.

## The kit

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | what this folder is, for a human |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **this file** — where we're at, W5+H, for an agent |
| `llm_wiki.md` | machine-facing index, generated not hand-written |
| `skill_manifest.json` | structured metadata |

## Working rules

- **Read everything, completely, before acting** (Rule 0).
- **One axis on disk** — organised by **domain**. Format tier and corpus type are
  frontmatter tags, never folders.
- **Four-artifact documents** — `name.pdf` + `name.md` + `name.jsonl` (when large)
  + `skills.md`. **Same basename = same document** is the audit's join key.
- **Metaphors:** behavioural ones never become enforcement code; visual references
  supplied with a picture *are* literal specs and get built exactly (Rule 7).
- **Verify mechanically** (Rule 4). Your own report is not evidence.
