😤 The Problem
Ever plugged your Android phone into your PC to figure out what’s eating all your storage?
Here’s what happens with the standard USB connection (MTP):
You open the phone in File Explorer / Finder
Click on a folder with lots of files
“Calculating size…” — hangs for 4+ minutes
Eventually shows sizes, but navigating is painfully slow
Trying to find large files? Good luck scrolling through hundreds of folders one by one
This is because MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) — the protocol your OS uses to talk to Android over USB —
was designed in 2008 for MP3 players. It transfers file metadata one item at a time, with no caching, no
parallel requests, and no way to do a fast recursive scan. It was never built for phones with 100GB+ of photos,
videos, and apps.
SocketSweep bypasses MTP entirely.
⚡ How Fast?
Full /sdcard scan on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (256GB) with ~47,000 files:
SocketSweep: ~6-15 seconds — full interactive treemap ready to explore.


Scan time varies depending on device load (background apps, media indexing, thermal state). Best case was
6.9 seconds with a warm cache and minimal background activity.
For comparison, doing the same thing over MTP (plugging in the phone and browsing via Windows Explorer or
Finder) typically involves minutes of “Calculating size…” freezes, and macOS Finder doesn’t even show folder
sizes at all.
Proper side-by-side benchmarks against OpenMTP and other tools are coming soon.

🚀 How to Use
1. Download
Download SocketSweep v1.0.0
Platform
Download
🪟 Windows
Installer (.exe) · Enterprise (.msi)
🍎 macOS (Apple Silicon)
Disk Image (.dmg)
🐧 Linux
AppImage · .deb
macOS note: Since the build is ad-hoc signed, run this once after installing:
2. Enable USB Debugging on your phone
Go to Settings → About Phone → tap “Build Number” 7 times to unlock Developer Options. Then go to
Settings → Developer Options → enable “USB Debugging”.
3. Plug in and scan
1. Connect your phone via USB cable
2. Open SocketSweep
3. Click Connect — the app will automatically push the daemon to your phone and set everything up
4. Click Scan — your full storage treemap loads in seconds
5. Click on any block in the treemap to drill down. Found something huge you don’t need? Delete it right
from the app.
That’s it. No apps to install on your phone, no Wi-Fi setup, no root required.
🧠 How It Works (The Short Version)
xattr -cr /Applications/SocketSweep.app


Instead of going through MTP, SocketSweep does something completely different:
1. Pushes a tiny C++ program (~1MB) to your phone via ADB
2. That program scans the filesystem directly on the phone using native POSIX calls — this is why it’s so
fast (no MTP bottleneck)
3. Streams the results back to your PC over a TCP socket through the USB cable
4. Renders an interactive treemap in a React frontend so you can visually see what’s taking space
The architecture was inspired by scrcpy — the “push a native binary via ADB, communicate over a local socket”
pattern.

🔧 Development Setup (Building from Source)
Prerequisites
1. Node.js (v18+)
2. Rust (v1.70+ with Cargo)
3. Android NDK (v26d or newer)
4. Android SDK / ADB installed and added to your system \$PATH.
1. Compile the C++ Daemon
Cross-compile the daemon for aarch64-linux-android :
# Set your NDK path
export NDK=/path/to/your/android-ndk-r26d
# Build the daemon


This generates the stripped daemon binary in the engine/ directory.
2. Install Frontend Dependencies
3. Run the App
Ensure your Android device is plugged in via USB and USB Debugging is enabled.
🛠 Troubleshooting
“0 Files” or Missing Folders on Android 11+
Android 11 introduced Scoped Storage, restricting file access. SocketSweep automatically tries to bypass this
via:
If scanning still shows nothing, check if your OEM requires extra toggles (e.g., Xiaomi needs “USB Debugging
(Security settings)” enabled).
Samsung Auto Blocker
If you’re on a Samsung device and USB Debugging is greyed out, you probably have Auto Blocker enabled. Go
to Settings → Security → Auto Blocker and turn it off. Auto Blocker disables USB Debugging entirely, so no
ADB-based tool (including SocketSweep) will work with it on. It’s off by default — you’d only have this issue if
you manually turned it on.
Daemon Fails to Start
If you get Permission denied , make sure the daemon is being pushed to /data/local/tmp/ . Modern Android
blocks execution from /sdcard/ . SocketSweep handles this automatically.
