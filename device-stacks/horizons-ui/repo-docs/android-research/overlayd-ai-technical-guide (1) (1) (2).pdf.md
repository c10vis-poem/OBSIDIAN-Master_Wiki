1The Core Problem: Android Sandbox Architecture

1
The Core Problem: Android Sandbox
Architecture
Understanding the Constraint
Android's security model places every application inside an isolated "Sandbox"
environment. This is a fundamental security feature designed to prevent malicious
applications from accessing system resources or interfering with other apps.
Termux, while powerful as a Linux environment emulator, operates within these same
constraints. Any process running inside Termux—including AI models—is fundamentally
trapped within this sandbox boundary. This creates a critical limitation:
Screen Access: AI cannot read or interact with the device's display
App Control: Cannot launch, close, or manipulate other applications
System Settings: Cannot toggle WiFi, Bluetooth, or modify system preferences
Hardware Control: Limited access to sensors, cameras, and other hardware
components
To enable true AI-driven device automation, we must architect a solution that "breaks out"
of this sandbox while maintaining system stability and security.
2 Breaking the Sandbox: Shizuku & Rish
2.1 The Privilege Escalation Mechanism
This is where the core innovation of Overlayd-AI resides. We leverage Android's built-in
developer infrastructure to achieve system-level access without requiring root privileges.


2Breaking the Sandbox: Shizuku & Rish

S
Shizuku
PRIVILEGE BROKER
An 
application 
that 
utilizes 
Android's
"Wireless Debugging" feature to acquire
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) permissions
without root access.
R
Rish
COMMAND WRAPPER
A special shell command exported from
Shizuku 
into 
Termux 
that 
executes
commands 
with 
elevated 
system
privileges.
2.2 The "God Mode" Execution Model
When we export the necessary files from Shizuku into the Termux environment, we gain
access to the 
rish command. Any command wrapped within 
rish executes with
system-level privileges:
# Example: Force home screen navigation
rish -c "input keyevent 3"
# Example: Launch YouTube application
rish -c "monkey -p com.google.android.youtube 1"
# Example: Toggle WiFi state
rish -c "svc wifi disable"
The Bridge is Established
This creates our critical bridge out of Termux. The AI, running within the sandbox,
can now execute commands that directly manipulate the Android system through
the rish tunnel.

3 The Brain: llama.cpp Inference Engine
3.1 Performance-First Architecture Decision
Traditional AI implementations on mobile devices rely on Python-based frameworks or
cloud API calls. Both approaches present significant limitations:

3.2 llama.cpp: Pure C/C++ Implementation
Our solution automatically downloads and compiles llama.cpp, a high-performance
inference engine written in pure C/C++. The compilation process uses cmake to target
the device's specific processor architecture, achieving mathematically optimal execution
speed.
OpenAI-Compatible Local Server
We configure llama.cpp to run as a persistent server on 
localhost:8080 ,
exposing an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. This allows any component in our
stack to communicate with the AI using standard HTTP requests.

# Server startup configuration
./server -m model.gguf \
         --host 127.0.0.1 \
         --port 8080 \
         -c 4096 \
         --timeout 300
4 The Logic Glue: Node.js & Telegram
Bridge
4.1 The Communication Pipeline
To map user chat messages to Shizuku commands, we implemented a lightweight
JavaScript bridge using Node.js ( telegram_bot.js ). This component serves as the
orchestration layer between natural language input and system-level execution.
Command Processing Flow
User Input
Telegram Bot
Few-Shot Prompting
LLM Inference
Command Parsing
Rish Execution
System Action
4.2 Few-Shot Prompting Strategy
The bridge uses carefully engineered few-shot prompting to guide the local AI in
generating structured command responses:
1
User Input Capture
Telegram bot receives natural language command (e.g., "Open YouTube")


4The Logic Glue: Node.js & Telegram Bridge
7
2
Contextual Prompt Construction
Node.js constructs a prompt with examples mapping intents to ADB commands
3
LLM Inference
Local AI processes the prompt and returns structured response
4
Command Extraction
Response parsed for CMD: prefix, raw command extracted
5
Privileged Execution
Command wrapped in rish tunnel and executed with system privileges
4.3 Example Execution Trace
# User sends: "Open YouTube"
# AI Response Format:
CMD: monkey -p com.google.android.youtube 1
# Node.js Processing:
const command = aiResponse.replace("CMD:", "").trim();
const rishCommand = `rish -c "${command}"`;
exec(rishCommand);
# Result: YouTube launches on device
Achievement: Fully Offline AI Control
The AI successfully opened YouTube using only local resources—no internet
connection required. The entire inference pipeline runs natively on the device.


5Vision Integration: OpenClaw & Multimodal AI
8
5 Vision 
Integration: 
OpenClaw 
&
Multimodal AI
5.1 Visual Understanding Capability
Qwen is a multimodal vision model, meaning it can process and understand visual
information in addition to text. This unlocks a critical capability: the AI can "see" the screen
and make decisions based on visual context.
5.2 OpenClaw Integration
We integrate OpenClaw, a third-party automation framework that provides:
Rapid Screenshot Capture: High-frequency screen capture for real-time visual
analysis
UI Layout Analysis: Extraction of interactive elements and their coordinates
Element Detection: Identification of buttons, text fields, and other UI components
5.3 The OpenClaw-Local Bridge
The Challenge
OpenClaw is designed to connect to ChatGPT over the internet. This violates our
offline-first requirement.
Our solution: a custom executable called openclaw-local that intercepts OpenClaw's
environment paths and redirects all API calls to our local server:


5Vision Integration: OpenClaw & Multimodal AI
9
# Intercepted endpoint configuration
BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
API_KEY = "sk-local-offline"  # Dummy key for compatibility
# All OpenAI-compatible endpoints redirected:
# - /v1/chat/completions
# - /v1/models
# - /v1/embeddings
5.4 Vision-to-Action Pipeline
Visual Automation Flow
Take Screenshot
UI Analysis
Send to LLM
Vision Inference
Extract Coordinates
Rish Tap Command
The result is a closed-loop system where OpenClaw captures the screen, funnels the
visual data entirely offline into the Llama engine, determines the location of target UI
elements, and uses rish to tap them natively.

7 Executive Summary
THE COMPLETE PICTURE
"We are deploying a lightweight C++ AI inference server directly on the
mobile device, communicating with it through a Telegram bot interface
running in the background. By granting this system Shizuku (Developer)
privileges, the AI can break out of the command terminal sandbox and
natively control phone settings, applications, and hardware—all while
completely disconnected from the internet."
